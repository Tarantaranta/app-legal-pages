  <p class="date">Effective date: May 14, 2025</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>MemePilot is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect or store your personal data that directly identifies you.</p>
    <p>When you use our meme generation features, the following types of information may be processed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meme Ideas and Topics:</strong> Text you provide as meme ideas or selected topics are sent to third-party AI services (such as OpenAI via Supabase Edge Functions) to generate punchlines and image prompts.</li>
      <li><strong>Uploaded Images:</strong> If you use the "Add Punchline to Image" feature, the selected image is processed by third-party AI services (such as OpenAI via Supabase Edge Functions) to understand its content and generate a relevant punchline.</li>
      <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> Images generated by AI services (like Replicate via Supabase Edge Functions) and the accompanying text (punchlines) are displayed within the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Data (Anonymous):</strong> We may use services like Supabase to store anonymous, session-related data, such as credit usage, to ensure the functionality of the app. This data is not linked to your personal identity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All processing via third-party services is done through secure, encrypted connections. We do not permanently store your original images or the text you input on our servers beyond the temporary processing period required by these services.</p>

      <li>To enable the "Add Punchline to Image" feature by analyzing the content of your uploaded image.</li>
      <li>Images and text you provide are <strong>not</strong> used for training third-party AI models unless explicitly stated by those third-party services in their respective privacy policies. We endeavor to use services that respect user data privacy.</li>
