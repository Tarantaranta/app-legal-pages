  <h1>Terms of Service for MemoryRevive</h1>
  <p class="date">Effective date: April 20, 2025</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using MemoryRevive, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. App Usage</h2>
    <p>MemoryRevive provides image restoration and enhancement features using AI models. You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app for lawful purposes only</li>
      <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer or decompile any part of the app</li>
      <li>Not use the app to process or create inappropriate or illegal content</li>
      <li>Not interfere with the app's security features</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The app and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by MemoryRevive and are protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Subscription and Payments</h2>
    <p>Some features of MemoryRevive require a subscription or credit purchase:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payments are processed through the App Store</li>
      <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled</li>
      <li>Refunds are handled according to App Store policies</li>
      <li>Credits do not expire but are non-refundable</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Subscription and Credit Policy</h2>
    <p>MemoryRevive offers two types of premium subscriptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly premium subscribers receive 150 credits each month.</li>
      <li>Annual premium subscribers receive 300 credits each month.</li>
      <li>Premium plan credits reset at the start of each monthly billing cycle to 150 or 300, regardless of unused balance.</li>
      <li>Premium credits cannot accumulate across months; unused credits are not carried over.</li>
      <li>Extra credit packs can be purchased separately at any time and are valid for 12 months from the purchase date.</li>
      <li>Extra credits are cumulative and are not affected by the monthly reset of premium plan credits.</li>
      <li>When the subscription is cancelled, users retain their existing premium credits until the end of their billing cycle. Afterward, any unused premium credits expire.</li>
      <li>Purchased extra credits remain valid after subscription cancellation and expire only after 12 months if unused.</li>
      <li>Users wishing to downgrade from an annual plan to a monthly plan must first cancel their current annual subscription before subscribing to a monthly plan.</li>
      <li>Premium credits are capped at 150 (monthly) or 300 (annual); only extra purchased credits allow the balance to exceed these limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a user has 40 premium credits remaining at the end of the billing cycle, the counter resets to 150 or 300 at the beginning of the next cycle. If 50 extra credits were purchased, the total will be 200 or 350, respectively.</p>
